When you initialize a repository a .git directory is created in your working directory.
This creates a directory where metadata about the history of the files in your repository can be stored

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it doesn't store files,
it's more of a temporary area to signal that these are files, from within a directory, to be tracked in a repository
It means that you can change you mind, using git reset, before files are committed to the repository and tracked
