Using diff to find bugs is useful because
it's easier for humans to spot changes than to spot mistakes

Having easy access to the entire history of a file
makes you a more efficient programmer in the long term
because making a mistake will not cost you time (you can go back to a previous version)
and you can compare different techniques side-by-side to determine which works best

the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does, are:
+ you can prevent superfluous versions buildng up
+ you can create versions at logical intervals so that it's easy to go back and see what was done
- you have to remember to commit
- you have to remember a logical system of when to commit

Some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately
Git does this so that a change in one file, which would also require a related file to be changed (e.g. calling a defined process) can be saved together.
This means that the logical change can be found using one commit, for all files - rather than finding multiple commits
Google Docs might choose to treat each file separately to avoid many identical verisons of files building up
(being saved, because a related file was changed, when no change was made to them)

The command git log allows you to view a list of commits
each with an ID, Date, Author and message
Git diff allows you to compare changes between two files,
specifically you can compare the changes between two commits using the IDs from GIT Log

Using version control can make you more confident to make changes that might break something because
you have the safety net of an older verison to revert back to, before the change was made
