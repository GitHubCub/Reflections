Using a remote repository can be useful if you want to access your files from another machine/location
It can also be useful if you want to share your files with other people for collaboration
or "publish" them for other people to use/review

You might want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository
because if you're collaborating with others or letting any public member add to your repository,
you might not always want to add thier changes into your repository
e.g. if 1000 people made a 1000 branches (one each) and Git auto-saved everything onto your local machine, that would be a lot of data
